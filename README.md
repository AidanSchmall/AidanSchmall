This bar graph shows how Carmelo Anthony is a very effective scorer. While looking at the graph it is clear that Carmelo Anthony, sadly, is past his prime and his scoring numbers have gone down a little bit. But it also shows how in his prime he was a very effective and consistent scorer year in and year out. 

### Timeline Project!

I chose to make an infographic showing Carmelo Anthony's amazing PPG (Points Per Game) statistic for his career! I think he is a very underrated player, and if someone would just look at his stats they would see that! He is one of the top scorers in NBA history! A common conversation among basketball fans is whether or not Carmelo Anthony should be a Hall Of Famer or not. Considering how proficent of a scorer he clearly is, I think he is a no-brainer.
