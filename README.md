![Carmelo Anthony's PPG (Points Per game) by Season](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460320/95494386-d84ce200-096b-11eb-863f-9db42b23af34.png)

This bar graph shows how Carmelo Anthony is a very effective scorer. While looking at the graph it is clear that Carmelo Anthony, sadly, is past his prime and his scoring numbers have gone down a little bit. But it also shows how in his prime he was a very effective and consistent scorer year in and year out. 

### Here is my timeline project!

### Here is my first project using *canva* ![Carmelo Anthony Stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71460320/94183289-3360de00-fe70-11ea-8747-1aa2872145e9.png)

I chose to make an infographic showing Carmelo Anthony's amazing PPG (Points Per Game) statistic for his career! I think he is a very underrated player, and if someone would just look at his stats they would see that! He is one of the top scorers in NBA history! A common conversation among basketball fans is whether or not Carmelo Anthony should be a Hall Of Famer or not. Considering how proficent of a scorer he clearly is, I think he is a no-brainer.
