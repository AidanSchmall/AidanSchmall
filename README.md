### Jordan Vs. Lebron
## Who is the greatest of all time?

From the graph it is clear that during Jordan's prime years he was untouchable, the undisputable king of basketball. On the other hand, Lebron James had a far more proficcent career or should I say consistent. The standard deviation for Jordan's career totals is far higher than that of Lebron's signifiying how he is less consistent. With Lebron's data it also shows how he has played at a top level for a much longer period of time where as Jordan played at the best level of any player for a short period of time. Jordan's peak was higher but Lebron's carreer is more consistent. The argument really comes down to whether a basketball team would enjoy more consistent results or be a mid tier team for a couple of years and then the best team in hisotry for a short amount of time and then returning to the middle of the pack, likely to never make it back to their once kingly status.

### Interactive Data Visualization

These graphs show the trends with respect to where Lehigh university students live and where they would like to party and where they are likely to go to a party. Interestingly enough the graph shows that students living on the hill would rather have parties off campus and not on the hill. It seems that they wouldn't want to party in the same place that they live so they don't have to clean up.

This map shows how well Carmelo Anthony has played throughout his carrer in differenct cities throughout america! Each point represents a team that Carmelo Anthony played for and his overall stats with those teams. He got from one team to the other through trades and free agency. This is interesting because you can see he clearly plays a lot better for certain teams. Specifically teams that treated him as an isolation scorer and not a role player. He was the "Top Gun" for the Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks, and his stats show that, for the other three teams he was just a role player... Sometimes not even a starter, this is not the Carmelo that we know, he needs to be played as a superstar because he is.

### Bar Chart!

This bar graph shows how Carmelo Anthony is a very effective scorer. While looking at the graph it is clear that Carmelo Anthony, sadly, is past his prime and his scoring numbers have gone down a little bit. But it also shows how in his prime he was a very effective and consistent scorer year in and year out.

I chose to make an infographic showing Carmelo Anthony's amazing PPG (Points Per Game) statistic for his career! I think he is a very underrated player, and if someone would just look at his stats they would see that! He is one of the top scorers in NBA history! A common conversation among basketball fans is whether or not Carmelo Anthony should be a Hall Of Famer or not. Considering how proficent of a scorer he clearly is, I think he is a no-brainer.
